{"name":"DIGital Historical Linguistics","tagline":"","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nIn this repository, various pieces of source code related to digital historical linguistics will be offered for testing and further development. The programs, most of which are written in JavaScript, mainly serve educational purposes, but some will also be useful for more advanced research in historical linguistics.\r\n\r\n### Educational Programs\r\n\r\nCurrently, the following programs are being offered:\r\n* [SoundChanger](sound_change/SoundChanger.html): A small program with help of which sound change from a source to a target language can be modelled with help of regular expressions. The accurracy of a set of regular expressions is automatically checked and displayed to the user.\r\n* [PhonAlign](edit/edit.html): A JavaScript implementation of algorithms for sequence alignment and calculation of the edit distance, supporting real-time alignment of two strings using the edit distance, and the alignment of multiple sequence pairs.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please me, using the email address you find at http://lingulist.de.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
